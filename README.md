## Objective
  As the pandemic continues, people tend to spend more time shopping on E-commerce platforms rather than shopping in real life. Under this background, it is increasingly important for E-commerce platforms to accurately analyze the likes and dislikes of each user, and recommend merchandise that the users need the most. In this project, our team aims to build a recommendation system that gives accurate suggestions for most of the users. We expect our model to have relatively good metric values in Precision, Recall and F1 score.
